Thanks for supporting the X-Cube Project! 

Assembly details:

	You will need:
	-6, M3-.5 x16 screws
	-A few compression springs that can be salvaged from a cheap clicking pen
	-Stickers: Available at http://cubesmith.com/3x3x3.htm
			21x White and Yellow 
			15x Green, Orange, Red, Blue 

	The number at the end of each file depicts the quantity of that piece needed for a full puzzle. 
     		[ex. you need 8 of Corner_Dual_Cut_8.stl]
		There are two core pieces to try, some hold screws better than others. 

     	IF YOU PRINT AN X-CUBE, YOU WILL PROBABLY WANT TO LUBRICATE IT! I SWEAR BY "CRC HEAVY DUTY SILICONE SPRAY": http://imgur.com/uraguGB
